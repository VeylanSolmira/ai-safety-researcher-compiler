# Migration Verification Summary

## ✅ Complete Migration Confirmed

All content from the legacy journey sections has been successfully migrated to the tier system.

### Content Migration Status

1. **All Legacy roadmapContentIds (7 total) - MIGRATED**
   - `prerequisites-topic` → foundation tier
   - `foundations-topic` → foundation tier  
   - `prompt-injection-subtopic` → foundation tier
   - `jailbreak-subtopic` → foundation tier
   - `data-poisoning-subtopic` → foundation tier
   - `adversarial-meta-learning-subtopic` → intermediate tier
   - `computer-security-subtopic` → foundation tier

2. **Legacy Structural Elements - PRESERVED**
   - Subsections → Topics within Modules
   - Section types (linear/open-world) → Tier types
   - Prerequisites/unlocks → Tier level prerequisites/unlocks
   - Assessment IDs → Preserved in relevant topics

3. **Special Features - MIGRATED**
   - `hasAdditionalContent` → Replaced with `additionalContentIds` array
   - `hasJourneyExtras` → Preserved in tier system
   - `hasInteractiveTransition` → Preserved in tier system

### Key Improvements in Tier System

1. **Enhanced Organization**
   - 3-level hierarchy: Tiers → Modules → Topics
   - Learning path filtering
   - Difficulty ratings per topic

2. **Richer Metadata**
   - Skills gained tracking
   - Career relevance mapping
   - Learning objectives per module
   - Related deep dives (case studies, experiments, explorations)

3. **Better Progress Tracking**
   - Granular completion at topic, module, and tier levels
   - Time tracking capabilities
   - Last activity tracking

### Backward Compatibility

The `JourneyProgress` interface maintains legacy fields:
- `currentSection`
- `sectionsCompleted`
- `sectionsStarted`
- `subsectionsCompleted`

This ensures users with existing progress won't lose their data during the transition.

## Recommendation

Consider implementing a one-time migration function to convert legacy progress to the new tier-based system when users first access the updated journey.
