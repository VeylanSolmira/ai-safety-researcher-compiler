## Recommendations

### High Priority Additions

1. **Cloud Infrastructure Module**
   - AWS/GCP/Azure fundamentals for ML
   - Cloud cost optimization
   - Managed ML services
   - Infrastructure as Code

2. **DevOps for AI Safety Module**
   - CI/CD pipelines for ML
   - Model versioning and deployment
   - Monitoring ML systems in production
   - A/B testing for safety features

3. **Data Engineering for Safety Research**
   - Building reliable data pipelines
   - Data versioning (DVC)
   - Feature stores
   - Data quality monitoring

### Medium Priority Additions

4. **Kubernetes for ML Workloads**
   - K8s fundamentals
   - Kubeflow introduction
   - GPU scheduling in K8s
   - Model serving on K8s

5. **Frontend Development for AI Tools**
   - Building AI safety dashboards
   - Visualization best practices
   - Frontend security for AI apps
   - Real-time model monitoring UIs

### Integration Opportunities

- Extend existing `containerization-research` topic to include Kubernetes
- Add cloud deployment sections to existing infrastructure topics
- Create a new "AI Safety Engineering" tier focusing on production systems
- Add practical DevOps exercises to existing safety tool building topics

## Conclusion

The AI Safety Research Compiler provides excellent coverage of AI safety-specific technical skills but lacks general software engineering infrastructure topics that are crucial for the METR role. The project is strong in research-oriented technical skills but would benefit from additional content on production systems, cloud infrastructure, and modern DevOps practices.

### Coverage Score: 7/12 core technical areas (58%)

The missing areas are primarily related to production deployment, cloud infrastructure, and modern platform engineering practices that would be essential for a Senior Software Engineer role at METR.
