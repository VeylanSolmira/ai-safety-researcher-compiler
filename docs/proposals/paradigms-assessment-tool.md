# Paradigm Assessment Tool Proposal

## Overview
Create an interactive tool that identifies a user's "paradigm fingerprint" - the small set of AI safety research paradigms they primarily use in their thinking and work.

## Goals
- Identify user's paradigm preferences with >95% confidence
- Minimize number of questions needed (target: 10-15 questions)
- Provide actionable insights about their research approach
- Connect users to relevant resources based on their paradigm profile

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Data Structure
```typescript
interface Paradigm {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  keyIndicators: string[]; // Phrases/concepts that indicate this paradigm
  opposingParadigms: string[]; // Paradigms that conflict with this one
  correlatedParadigms: string[]; // Often appear together
}

interface Question {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  options: Option[];
  paradigmDiscrimination: Map<string, number>; // How well it separates paradigms
}

interface Option {
  text: string;
  paradigmWeights: Map<string, number>; // Positive/negative weights for each paradigm
}

interface AssessmentResult {
  primaryParadigms: string[]; // Top 3-5 paradigms
  confidence: number; // 0-100%
  explanation: string;
  suggestedResources: Resource[];
}
```

### 2. Algorithm Design

**Adaptive Questioning Strategy:**
1. Start with high-discrimination questions that separate major paradigm clusters
2. Use information gain to select next question based on current probability distribution
3. Stop when confidence threshold reached or max questions asked

**Scoring Mechanism:**
- Bayesian update of paradigm probabilities after each answer
- Track both positive indicators (this paradigm likely) and negative (this paradigm unlikely)
- Consider paradigm correlations in updates

### 3. Question Design Principles

**Types of Questions:**
1. **Scenario-based**: "When approaching a new AI safety problem, you would first..."
2. **Trade-off**: "Which is more important: mathematical rigor or empirical results?"
3. **Methodology**: "Your ideal research process involves..."
4. **Values**: "The biggest risk from AI comes from..."
5. **Tool preference**: "You're most comfortable working with..."

**Question Properties:**
- Each question should strongly discriminate between at least 2-3 paradigm clusters
- Avoid jargon that would confuse newcomers
- Include "Not sure" options to avoid forced choices

### 4. Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Data Preparation**
- Extract all paradigms from comprehensive topic
- Create paradigm correlation matrix
- Design initial question bank (20-30 questions)

**Phase 2: Core Algorithm**
- Implement Bayesian scoring system
- Create adaptive question selection
- Build confidence calculation

**Phase 3: UI/UX**
- Clean, engaging interface
- Progress indicator
- Skip/back navigation
- Results visualization (radar chart?)

**Phase 4: Integration**
- Connect results to learning paths
- Suggest mentors/resources
- Save results to user profile

## Example Questions

1. **Opening Question** (separates empirical vs theoretical):
   "How do you prefer to validate AI safety ideas?"
   - Run experiments with actual AI systems
   - Mathematical proofs and formal analysis
   - Thought experiments and conceptual arguments
   - Historical case studies and analogies

2. **Governance vs Technical**:
   "The most effective path to AI safety is through:"
   - Better algorithms and technical solutions
   - Policy and institutional frameworks
   - Both equally important
   - Depends on the timeline we're considering

3. **Scale of Focus**:
   "When thinking about AI risks, you focus on:"
   - Near-term harms from current systems
   - Long-term existential risks
   - The transition period between current and future AI
   - All timescales equally

## Success Metrics
- Average questions to 95% confidence: <15
- User satisfaction with results: >80% agree with assessment
- Completion rate: >70% of users who start finish
- Actionable outcomes: >60% explore suggested resources

## Next Steps
1. Review comprehensive paradigms content
2. Create paradigm correlation analysis
3. Design initial question bank
4. Build prototype with 5-10 questions
5. Test with known paradigm examples
6. Iterate based on results

## Status
**Created**: January 2025
**Status**: COMPLETE - Full implementation ready for testing
**Completed**: 
- ✅ All 40 paradigms extracted from database with full metadata
- ✅ API endpoint implemented (/api/paradigms-assessment)
- ✅ UI page created (/journey/paradigms-assessment)
- ✅ Bayesian update algorithm with confidence calculation
- ✅ 15 comprehensive questions with weighted options
- ✅ Smart question selection based on information gain
- ✅ Paradigm correlations and oppositions mapped
- ✅ Topic suggestions based on paradigm results
- ✅ Results visualization with confidence and category distribution

**Ready for Use**:
The paradigm assessment tool is now fully functional with:
- 40 paradigms across 10 categories
- 15 discriminating questions (each with 5 options)
- Adaptive questioning that stops at 95% confidence or 15 questions
- Results showing top 5 paradigms, category weights, and suggested learning paths
- Clean UI with progress tracking and results visualization

## Implementation Details
- **Algorithm**: Bayesian probability updates with entropy-based confidence
- **Question Selection**: Information gain calculation for optimal ordering
- **Topic Mapping**: Each paradigm suggests 3-6 relevant learning topics
- **UI Flow**: Start → Questions → Results with paradigm fingerprint
- **API Routes**: POST (init), PUT (answer), GET (preview questions)

## Testing Next Steps
1. User testing with known paradigm examples
2. Refine question weights based on feedback
3. Add more sophisticated visualizations (radar charts)
4. Connect to actual journey learning paths
5. Save assessment results to user profile
