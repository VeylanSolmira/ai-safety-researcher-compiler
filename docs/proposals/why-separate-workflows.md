# Why Separate Deployment Workflows?

## The Fundamental Difference

**You're building two different versions of your app:**

1. **Full Next.js App** (Vercel)
   ```bash
   npm run build     # Creates .next folder
   vercel deploy     # Deploys server + client code
   ```

2. **Static HTML Site** (GitHub Pages)
   ```bash
   npm run export    # Creates out folder with static files
   deploy to pages   # Serves static files only
   ```

## Why Not Merge?

### Different Build Commands
```yaml
# Can't do both in one job efficiently
- run: npm run build    # For Vercel (server-side)
- run: npm run export   # For GitHub Pages (static)
```

Running both would:
- Double the build time
- Create confusion about which output to use
- Waste CI minutes

### Different Deployment Steps
```yaml
# Vercel deployment
- run: vercel deploy --prod

# GitHub Pages deployment  
- uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
- uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

These are completely different deployment mechanisms that can't be combined.

### Different Triggers?
You might want:
- Every push → Vercel (immediate preview)
- Only releases → GitHub Pages (stable static version)

## Could We Merge Them?

Technically yes, but it would be messy:

```yaml
name: Deploy Everything
on: push

jobs:
  deploy-vercel:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - npm install
      - npm run build
      - vercel deploy

  deploy-github-pages:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - npm install  # Duplicate work
      - npm run export
      - deploy to pages
```

This approach:
- ❌ Runs npm install twice
- ❌ Can't share build artifacts easily
- ❌ Harder to debug when one fails
- ❌ Can't disable one without editing workflow

## Better Approach: Keep Them Separate

1. **Clear separation of concerns**
2. **Can disable/enable independently**
3. **Different schedules if needed**
4. **Easier to understand and maintain**

## Alternative: Single Workflow, Multiple Jobs

If you really want one file:

```yaml
name: Deploy All
on: push

jobs:
  build-and-deploy-vercel:
    # Vercel-specific steps
    
  build-and-deploy-pages:
    # GitHub Pages-specific steps
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'  # Maybe only on main
```

But this still doesn't save much - the builds are fundamentally different.
