## Priority Topics to Create

Based on paradigm popularity and practical value, prioritize creating:

1. **value-alignment** - Central to many safety approaches
2. **deployment-gates** - Practical safety measure
3. **robustness-testing** - Essential for safety evaluation
4. **failure-modes** - Critical for understanding risks
5. **human-ai-collaboration** - Increasingly relevant
6. **containment-strategies** - Important for risk mitigation
7. **transformation-scenarios** - Helps with long-term planning
8. **philosophical-foundations** - Grounds the entire field

## Implementation Suggestions

For each missing topic, create:
- Academic content explaining the concept
- Personal perspective on why it matters
- Connections to existing topics
- Practical examples or case studies
- Further reading suggestions

Consider grouping related missing topics into new modules:
- "AI Development Safety" module (developmental-safety, deployment-gates, etc.)
- "Human-AI Integration" module (collaboration, augmentation, enhancement)
- "Philosophical Foundations" module (cosmological, consciousness, reality topics)

## Alternative Approach

Instead of creating all missing topics, could update `generateTopicSuggestions()` to only reference existing topics, mapping paradigms to the most relevant available content. This would make the tool immediately functional while gaps are filled over time.
