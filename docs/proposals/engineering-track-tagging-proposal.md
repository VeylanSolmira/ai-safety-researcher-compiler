## Tagging Strategy

### 1. Direct Engineering Tags

All 31 topics above should receive the `engineering` tag to indicate they are core to the engineering track.

### 2. Topics Requiring Engineering Variants

Many topics have general content that would benefit from engineering-specific deep dives:

#### Foundation Topics Needing Engineering Content:
- **intro-red-teaming**: Add hands-on tooling setup and automation
- **basic-interpretability**: Add implementation of interpretability tools
- **prompt-injection-attacks**: Add code examples and defense implementations
- **jailbreak-techniques**: Add technical detection and prevention code
- **safety-evaluation-101**: Add benchmark implementation details
- **how-llms-work**: Add low-level implementation details
- **risk-assessment-intro**: Add automated risk assessment tools

#### Intermediate Topics Needing Engineering Content:
- **problem-decomposition**: Add software architecture patterns
- **iterative-research**: Add CI/CD for research workflows
- **research-project-mgmt**: Add technical project management tools
- **agent-architectures**: Add implementation patterns and frameworks
- **agent-safety-fundamentals**: Add safety harness implementations
- **human-agent-interaction**: Add UI/UX engineering for safety
- **mechanistic-interp**: Add tool implementation guides
- **llm-psychology**: Add behavioral testing frameworks
- **chain-of-thought-analysis**: Add analysis pipeline implementation

#### Advanced Topics Needing Engineering Content:
- **multi-agent-coordination**: Add distributed systems implementation
- **emergent-behaviors**: Add monitoring and detection systems
- **circuit-discovery**: Add automated discovery tools
- **scalable-interpretability**: Add infrastructure for scale

### 3. Module-Level Recommendations

#### Strongly Engineering-Oriented Modules:
1. **Production Safety Engineering** (100% engineering topics)
2. **Testing & Evaluation** (100% engineering topics)
3. **Advanced Safety Systems Design** (100% engineering topics)

#### Mixed Modules Needing Track Separation:
1. **Practical AI Safety Basics**: Mix of conceptual and hands-on
2. **Applied Interpretability**: Mix of theory and implementation
3. **AI Agents & Tool Use**: Mix of design and implementation
4. **Advanced Red Teaming & Adversarial ML**: Mix of theory and practice

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core Tagging (Immediate)
1. Add `engineering` tag to all 31 identified topics
2. Create database field for track tags if not exists
3. Update UI to filter by track

### Phase 2: Content Variants (Week 1-2)
1. Create engineering-specific content variants for mixed topics
2. Store as `content_engineering` field alongside `content_academic` and `content_personal`
3. Focus on adding:
   - Code examples and implementations
   - Tool setup and configuration guides
   - Architecture patterns and best practices
   - Performance and scalability considerations
   - Deployment and monitoring strategies

### Phase 3: New Engineering-Specific Topics (Week 3-4)
Consider adding new topics specifically for engineers:
1. **ai-safety-cicd**: CI/CD Pipelines for AI Safety Tools
2. **safety-testing-frameworks**: Building Safety Testing Frameworks
3. **llm-observability**: LLM Observability and Monitoring
4. **safety-benchmarking-infra**: Safety Benchmarking Infrastructure
5. **model-versioning**: Model Versioning and Rollback Strategies
6. **safety-feature-flags**: Feature Flags for AI Safety
7. **ai-safety-sdks**: Building AI Safety SDKs and Libraries
8. **safety-integration-patterns**: Integration Patterns for Safety Tools

### Phase 4: Learning Path Creation (Week 4+)
1. Create explicit "Engineering Track" learning path
2. Sequence topics for progressive skill building
3. Add engineering-specific prerequisites
4. Create hands-on projects linking multiple topics

## Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- Add track support to topics
ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN tracks TEXT; -- JSON array of tracks

-- Add engineering-specific content
ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN content_engineering TEXT;

-- Create track metadata table
CREATE TABLE tracks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  color TEXT,
  icon TEXT,
  position INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);

-- Insert engineering track
INSERT INTO tracks (id, name, description, color, icon) VALUES (
  'engineering',
  'Engineering Track',
  'Hands-on implementation and technical infrastructure for AI safety',
  '#10B981',
  'wrench'
);
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Coverage**: 50%+ of topics have engineering-relevant content
2. **Depth**: Engineering topics include runnable code examples
3. **Progression**: Clear path from beginner to expert engineering skills
4. **Practical**: Each module includes hands-on implementation projects
5. **Industry-Ready**: Content prepares engineers for real-world AI safety roles

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this proposal
2. Implement Phase 1 tagging immediately
3. Begin content creation for Phase 2
4. Recruit engineering practitioners to review and contribute content
5. Test with target audience (ML engineers, safety engineers)
