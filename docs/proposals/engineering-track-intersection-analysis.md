# Engineering Track Proposals Intersection Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes how the **Engineering Track Tagging Proposal** and the **Engineering Roles Curriculum Design** intersect and complement each other.

## Key Similarities

### 1. Single Engineering Track Approach
Both proposals converge on creating a single, unified engineering track rather than multiple specialized tracks:
- **Tagging Proposal**: Identifies 31 core engineering topics to tag
- **Curriculum Design**: Proposes one "AI Safety Engineer" track covering full stack

### 2. Database Schema Alignment
Both propose similar database modifications:
- **Tagging Proposal**: `ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN tracks TEXT;` (JSON array)
- **Curriculum Design**: `ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN track TEXT DEFAULT 'general';` (single value)

**Recommendation**: Use the simpler single-value approach from Curriculum Design since we're focusing on one engineering track.

### 3. Content Philosophy
Both emphasize practical, hands-on engineering content:
- **Tagging Proposal**: "Code examples and implementations", "Tool setup guides"
- **Curriculum Design**: "Build infrastructure and tools for AI safety work"

## Key Differences

### 1. Scope
- **Tagging Proposal**: Works with existing topics (31 identified + variants)
- **Curriculum Design**: Proposes new modules and topics specific to engineering

### 2. Implementation Approach
- **Tagging Proposal**: Tag existing content and create variants
- **Curriculum Design**: Create new engineering-specific modules

### 3. Content Storage
- **Tagging Proposal**: Suggests `content_engineering` field for variants
- **Curriculum Design**: Uses track filtering on existing content

## Unified Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. Implement simple track system from Curriculum Design:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN track TEXT DEFAULT 'general';
   ```
2. Tag the 31 existing engineering topics identified in Tagging Proposal
3. Add track toggle UI component

### Phase 2: Content Integration (Weeks 2-3)
1. Create new engineering modules from Curriculum Design:
   - Production Infrastructure for AI Safety
   - Data Engineering for Safety Evaluation
   - Platform Engineering for AI Safety
   - Security & Reliability Engineering
   - Full-Stack Safety Tools

2. Place existing tagged topics within these new modules where appropriate

### Phase 3: Content Enhancement (Weeks 4-5)
1. For topics identified in Tagging Proposal as needing "engineering variants":
   - Don't create separate `content_engineering` field
   - Instead, create new engineering-specific topics that build on the general ones
   - Example: "Docker & Containerization" (general) â†’ "Kubernetes for Model Evaluation" (engineering)

### Phase 4: Gap Filling (Week 6)
1. Add new engineering topics suggested in Tagging Proposal:
   - ai-safety-cicd
   - safety-testing-frameworks
   - llm-observability
   - safety-benchmarking-infra
   - model-versioning
   - safety-feature-flags
   - ai-safety-sdks
   - safety-integration-patterns

## Merged Module Structure

### Foundation Tier
- Keep existing tagged topics
- Add basic engineering prerequisites

### Intermediate Tier
**Core Engineering Module** (NEW)
- Production Infrastructure for AI Safety
- Data Engineering for Safety Evaluation
- Include existing topics:
  - containerization-research
  - distributed-training
  - safety-monitoring
  - deployment-gates

**Production Safety Engineering** (EXISTING)
- Already 100% engineering topics
- Enhance with new infrastructure content

### Advanced Tier
**Platform Engineering Module** (NEW)
- Advanced Kubernetes
- Multi-tenant Platforms
- Infrastructure as Code

**Advanced Safety Systems Design** (EXISTING)
- Already 100% engineering topics
- Add new security engineering content

## Content Mapping

| Tagging Proposal Topic | Curriculum Design Module | Integration |
|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| containerization-research | Production Infrastructure | Direct fit |
| distributed-training | Data Engineering | Direct fit |
| safety-apis | Full-Stack Safety Tools | Direct fit |
| incident-response | Security & Reliability | Direct fit |
| deployment-gates | CI/CD for Safety-Critical | Direct fit |

## Recommendations

1. **Use Single Track Field**: Adopt the simpler `track TEXT` approach from Curriculum Design
2. **Create New Modules**: Implement the engineering modules from Curriculum Design
3. **Tag Existing Content**: Apply engineering tags to the 31 identified topics
4. **Build Prerequisites**: Create clear progression from existing to new content
5. **Focus on METR Requirements**: Ensure coverage of all skills needed for target employers

## Next Steps

1. Finalize database schema (single track field)
2. Create module structure combining both proposals
3. Tag existing 31 engineering topics
4. Create new engineering-specific content
5. Build engineering learning path
6. Test with target audience

## Success Metrics (Combined)

1. **Coverage**: All 31 existing + new engineering topics integrated
2. **METR Alignment**: 100% coverage of required skills
3. **Progression**: Clear path from basics to expert
4. **Practical**: Every topic includes hands-on implementation
5. **Industry-Ready**: Graduates prepared for AI safety engineering roles
