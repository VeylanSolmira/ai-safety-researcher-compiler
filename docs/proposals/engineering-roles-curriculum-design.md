## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Database Schema Updates

```sql
-- Add role tags to topics
ALTER TABLE topics ADD COLUMN role_tags TEXT DEFAULT NULL;

-- Example: 'platform_engineer,safety_tools_engineer'

-- Add user role preferences
CREATE TABLE user_role_preferences (
  user_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  selected_roles TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON array of role IDs
  created_at INTEGER DEFAULT (unixepoch()),
  updated_at INTEGER DEFAULT (unixepoch())
);
```

  - Forensics for AI attacks
  - Rollback procedures
  - Post-mortem processes

## UI/UX Changes

### 1. Role Selection During Onboarding
```typescript
interface RoleSelectionProps {
  roles: [
    {
      id: 'platform_engineer',
      title: 'AI Safety Platform Engineer',
      description: 'Build infrastructure for safe AI',
      icon: '🏗️',
      skillsHighlight: ['Cloud', 'Kubernetes', 'MLOps']
    },
    // ... other roles
  ]
}
```

### 2. Topic Filtering
```typescript
// In topic queries
function getTopicsForUser(tierId: string, userId: string) {
  const userRoles = getUserRoles(userId);
  return db.prepare(`
    SELECT * FROM topics 
    WHERE tier_id = ? 
    AND (
      role_tags IS NULL 
      OR EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM json_each(role_tags) 
        WHERE value IN (${userRoles.map(() => '?').join(',')})
      )
    )
  `).all(tierId, ...userRoles);
}
```

### 3. Visual Indicators
- Role badges on topics: 🏗️ Platform | 🛠️ Tools | 🧠 ML | 🔒 Security | 🏛️ Governance
- "Recommended for your role" highlights
- Progress tracking per role

## Content Creation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Platform Engineering (METR-aligned)
1. Cloud Infrastructure for AI Safety
2. Kubernetes for Model Evaluation
3. MLOps & Evaluation Pipelines
4. Monitoring & Observability

### Phase 2: Broader Engineering Roles
1. Frontend Development for Safety Tools
2. API Design for Safety Systems
3. Advanced Container Security
4. Building Research Infrastructure

### Phase 3: Specialized Content
1. AI-Specific Security Measures
2. Incident Response for AI Systems
3. Governance Infrastructure
4. Compliance Tooling

## Migration Path

1. Add `role_tags` column to topics table
2. Tag existing content with appropriate roles
3. Create new engineering-focused topics
4. Implement role selection UI
5. Add filtering logic to topic queries
6. Update journey paths to respect role preferences

## Benefits

- **Targeted Learning**: Engineers see content relevant to their career goals
- **Industry Alignment**: Content matches real job requirements (like METR's)
- **Flexibility**: Users can select multiple roles or change focus
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new roles and content
- **Clear Pathways**: From fundamentals to role-specific expertise

## Next Steps

1. Implement database schema changes
2. Create role selection UI component
3. Start creating Phase 1 content (METR-aligned)
4. Update existing content with role tags
5. Test with users interested in engineering roles
