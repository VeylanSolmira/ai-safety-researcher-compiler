# Feature Ideas

This directory contains explorations of potential features for the AI Safety Research Compiler. These are not commitments to build, but rather thoughtful considerations of what might add value to the platform.

## Current Feature Ideas

### [Learning Timeline](./learning-timeline.md)
A domain-specific timeline for tracking AI safety learning milestones, application deadlines, and personal progress. Not a general calendar, but a focused tool for the AI safety journey.
