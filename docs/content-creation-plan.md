## Progress Tracking

- **Total topics needing content**: 30
- **Completed**: 2 (6.7%)
- **Remaining**: 28 (93.3%)

### Completion by Category
- Priority 1 (Both missing): 2/2 ✓ (100%)
- Priority 2 (Personal only): 0/28 (0%)

## Next Steps

1. Focus on mathematical/technical foundations first as these are prerequisite topics
2. Move to AI paradigms content next as it provides conceptual framework
3. Then tackle alignment and safety research topics
4. Finally address specialized and advanced topics

## Notes

- All topics already have academic content, so only personal perspectives need to be written
- Personal content should complement the academic content with practical insights and personal experiences
- Maintain consistency with the personal voice established in existing content
