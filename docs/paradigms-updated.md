   - Developmental paradigms → value learning
   - Tool paradigms → control mechanisms

3. **What paradigms are notably absent from current discourse?**
   - Aesthetic/artistic framings of AI
   - Indigenous knowledge systems
   - Non-Western philosophical approaches
   - Queer theory perspectives

4. **How do cultural backgrounds influence paradigm preference?**

  - Metaphors become self-fulfilling prophecies
  - Need conscious paradigm diversity

- **Multiple simultaneous truths**: Several paradigms may apply
  - AI might be tool AND child AND predator
  - Different aspects visible through different lenses
  - Synthesis requires holding multiple views

- **Paradigm warfare**: Competition between frames as political
  - Funding follows dominant paradigms
  - Safety strategies depend on framing
  - Power dynamics in paradigm selection

- **Emergent paradigms**: New metaphors arising from AI behavior itself
  - AI might suggest its own paradigms
  - Novel behaviors need novel frameworks
  - Stay open to AI-generated metaphors

The choice of paradigm isn't neutral; it's a profound ethical and practical decision that shapes how we build, govern, and relate to AI systems.

For safety researchers, the key insight is that we must consciously choose and critique our paradigms, understanding their benefits and limitations. The most robust safety strategies likely require drawing from multiple paradigms while remaining alert to their biases and blind spots.
