## Case Study: When Writing About Injection Causes Injection

During the development of this very course, we encountered a perfect example of why injection attacks are so fundamental. While writing content about prompt injection attacks (including the text you're reading now), the code generation system crashed with a template literal injection vulnerability.

**What Happened**: The educational examples of injection attacks contained triple backticks (\`\`\`), which broke the TypeScript template literal system being used to generate the content. The content about code injection literally became a code injection.

**The Beautiful Irony**: 
- We couldn't write about prompt injection without causing an injection
- The defensive examples became attack vectors
- The education material compromised the education system

**Why This Matters**: This demonstrates that the code/data boundary problem isn't just theoretical - it's so fundamental that it affects the very systems we use to teach about it. If we can't even safely write about these vulnerabilities, how can we expect AI systems to safely process arbitrary inputs?

> "Everything on the internet is now executable code" - and this includes educational content about why everything being executable is dangerous.

For the full analysis, see: [Template Literal Injection Case Study](/development-resources/case-studies/template-literal-injection.md)

This real-world example shows why Simon Willison's observation that prompt injection is unsolvable isn't hyperbole - it's a fundamental property of systems that process symbolic information.
