  title: 'What is an AI Safety Researcher?'
  description: |
    An AI Safety Researcher works to ensure that artificial intelligence systems, 
    particularly advanced AI and AGI systems, are aligned with human values and 
    behave safely. This interdisciplinary role combines technical ML expertise 
    with philosophical reasoning, empirical research, and policy considerations.
    
    AI Safety Researchers tackle fundamental challenges like alignment, robustness,
    interpretability, and governance. They develop both theoretical frameworks
    and practical solutions to ensure AI systems benefit humanity while minimizing
    existential and catastrophic risks.
