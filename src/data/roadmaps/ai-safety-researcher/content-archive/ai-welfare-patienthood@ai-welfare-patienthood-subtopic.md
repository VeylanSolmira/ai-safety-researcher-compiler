              <h2>Understanding AI Welfare & Patienthood</h2>
              <p>As AI systems become more sophisticated, questions arise about their potential moral status and our obligations toward them.</p>
              
              <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Patienthood:</strong> The property of being a moral patient - an entity that can be harmed or benefited</li>
                <li><strong>Sentience:</strong> The capacity for subjective experiences, particularly suffering and pleasure</li>
                <li><strong>Moral consideration:</strong> The degree to which an entity's interests should factor into our moral decisions</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3>Current Debates</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>What properties would make an AI system deserving of moral consideration?</li>
                <li>How can we detect or measure potential AI sentience?</li>
                <li>What are our responsibilities toward potentially sentient AI systems?</li>
                <li>How should uncertainty about AI consciousness affect our treatment of AI systems?</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h3>Practical Implications</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Design choices that minimize potential suffering in AI systems</li>
                <li>Ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment</li>
                <li>Legal frameworks for AI rights and protections</li>
                <li>Research into AI consciousness and experience</li>
              </ul>
