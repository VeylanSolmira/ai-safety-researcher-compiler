## Embedded Agency

Traditional decision theory assumes agents are separate from their environment. Embedded agents are part of the world they're reasoning about.

### Key Challenges

-   **Self-Reference:** Agent's computations affect the world being modeled
-   **Logical Uncertainty:** Limited compute means uncertain about logical facts
-   **Naturalized Induction:** Learning while embedded in environment
-   **Robust Delegation:** Creating successors or modifying oneself

### Decision Theory Problems

-   Newcomb's Problem and decision theory paradoxes
-   Logical counterfactuals and updateless decision theory
-   Coordination without communication
-   Reflective stability and self-modification

### Implications for AI Safety

-   AIs reasoning about their own training
-   Self-fulfilling prophecies and fixed points
-   Corrigibility and shutdown problems
-   Value stability under self-improvement

### Research Directions

-   Logical induction and bounded rationality
-   Functional decision theory
-   Cartesian frames and boundaries
-   Finite factored sets
