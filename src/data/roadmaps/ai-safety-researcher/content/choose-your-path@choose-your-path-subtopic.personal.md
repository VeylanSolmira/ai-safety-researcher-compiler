# Your AI Safety Journey - The Real Path

Let me save you some time and pain: most career guides in AI safety are written by people who took traditional paths and assume you will too. Here's the actual map of the territory, scars and all.

## The Truth About AI Safety Careers

First, let's be honest about what you're signing up for:

- **Lower pay** than capability research (usually 30-50% less)
- **Less prestige** than working on the latest LLM
- **Harder problems** with less clear metrics of success
- **Constant existential dread** (occupational hazard)
- **Amazing colleagues** who actually give a damn about humanity

Still interested? Good. You might actually last.

## The Paths Nobody Tells You About

### The "Fuck It, I'll Do It Myself" Path

Some of the best safety researchers I know just... started doing safety research. No PhD, no prestigious lab, just:
1. Pick a safety problem that pisses you off
2. Start working on it publicly
3. Share your work, get feedback
4. Iterate until people notice
5. Get hired or get funded

Examples: Several Anthropic researchers, independent alignment researchers, safety tool builders

### The "Trojan Horse" Path

Get hired for capabilities, redirect efforts to safety:
1. Join a major lab as an engineer/researcher
2. Excel at your main job
3. Gradually shift focus to safety problems
4. Build internal support for safety work
5. Eventually transition full-time to safety

This actually works IF you have the discipline not to get nerd-sniped by capabilities.

### The "Safety Mercenary" Path

Consultant/contractor focusing on safety:
1. Build deep expertise in one safety area
2. Work with multiple organizations
3. Cross-pollinate ideas between groups
4. Maintain independence
5. Go where you're most needed

Great for experienced folks who want flexibility and impact.

## My Biased Take on Each Path

### Technical Research
**The Reality**: You'll spend 80% of your time on infrastructure, experiments that fail, and reading papers. The 20% of actual research is incredible, but you need high tolerance for frustration.

**Who thrives**: People who can find joy in incremental progress and have monk-like patience.

**Who burns out**: Those who need constant validation or clear wins.

### Safety Engineering  
**The Reality**: You're the person saying "no" a lot. You'll be seen as slowing things down. Your wins are invisible (prevented disasters).

**Who thrives**: People with thick skin who find satisfaction in defense, not offense.

**Who burns out**: Those who need to be liked or want visible impact.

### Policy and Governance
**The Reality**: Glacial pace of change. You'll write brilliant proposals that get watered down or ignored. But when you win, you win big.

**Who thrives**: Long-term thinkers with political savvy.

**Who burns out**: Idealists who can't compromise.

### Field Building
**The Reality**: You're a gardener planting seeds you might never see bloom. Lots of logistics, people management, and fundraising.

**Who thrives**: Natural connectors who measure success in others' growth.

**Who burns out**: Those who need direct technical contribution.

## The Skills That Actually Matter

Forget the formal prerequisites. Here's what actually determines success:

1. **Epistemic humility**: Ability to be wrong and update. Crucial.
2. **Communication across domains**: Can you explain alignment to a policymaker? RL to a philosopher?
3. **Emotional resilience**: This work can be psychologically brutal
4. **Self-direction**: Nobody knows what to do. Figure it out.
5. **Collaborative mindset**: Lone wolves don't last in safety

## How to Actually Get Started (Skip the BS)

### Week 1-2: Reality Check
- Read "Concrete Problems in AI Safety" (actually read it)
- Try to jailbreak Claude or GPT-4
- Join one Discord/Slack and lurk
- Write up what confused or surprised you

### Month 1: Get Your Hands Dirty
- Build something safety-related (however small)
- Reproduce one result from a safety paper
- Write one blog post about what you learned
- Get one piece of feedback from someone in the field

### Month 2-3: Find Your Angle
- Identify what you're uniquely positioned to contribute
- Start a project that uses your existing skills
- Share work-in-progress publicly
- Connect with 2-3 people working on similar problems

### Month 4-6: Build Credibility
- Complete one substantial project
- Contribute to existing safety tools/research
- Apply to programs/internships/fellowships
- Start building your safety portfolio

## The Uncomfortable Truths

### You Probably Won't Save the World
But you might contribute to the team that does. Make peace with being a small part of something crucial.

### The Field is Political AF
Despite the common goal, there are factions, drama, and ideology. Navigate carefully.

### Burnout is Real
I've seen brilliant people flame out. Pace yourself. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

### Timing Matters
The field is moving fast. Opportunities that exist today might not tomorrow. But new ones will emerge.

## My Personal Advice

1. **Start before you're ready**: Perfect preparation is procrastination
2. **Build in public**: Share your journey, mistakes included
3. **Find your tribe**: You need peers who get why this matters
4. **Maintain perspective**: Important work doesn't mean sacrificing your life
5. **Stay technical**: Even non-technical paths benefit from technical understanding

## The Paths I'd Take Today

If I were starting over:

**With technical background**: Jump straight into mechanistic interpretability or evaluations. Concrete, important, and hiring.

**Without technical background**: Policy or field building, but learn enough ML to be dangerous. Take fast.ai.

**With 10 years to impact**: PhD at a top lab, but with safety focus from day one.

**With 1 year to impact**: Join an existing safety team and learn by doing.

## Your Next Move

Stop reading career guides (including this one) and:
1. Pick the smallest possible safety project you can complete
2. Complete it this week
3. Share it somewhere public
4. Get one piece of feedback
5. Iterate

The path becomes clear by walking, not by planning.

Welcome to the most important work you'll ever do. It's hard, it's uncertain, and it matters more than anything else.

Now stop reading and start building. The future is watching.
