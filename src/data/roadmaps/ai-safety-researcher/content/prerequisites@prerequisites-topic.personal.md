# Core Prerequisites (Personal View)

<!-- This is the personal/informal version of prerequisites@prerequisites -->

## Quick Overview

ðŸŽ¯ **What is this about?**
I am going to dare to try a radically different paradigm for aspiring AI Safety Researchers -- to lead with an ethical and ecological orientation to the topic of AI rather than

The project is designed to take motivated human beings and help them have ethical and useful safety impact on the generation, deployment, and integration of AI into Earth's biosphere.

ðŸ’­ **Why should you care?**
AI is going to have impact across multiple areas of existence, from identity, labor, concentration of power, existential risk, possible ecosystem destruction.

ðŸ”‘ **Key Concepts**
As this project is designed to help organize my thinking in addition -- in significant part by my creating the teaching materials I think I and a hypothetical student would need to reach the goal of becoming an AI safety researcher -- we'll do deeper dives into the mathematical, machine learning, and, computer science skills as they connect with our specific goals along our journey. 

## Learning Tips

[Add personal learning strategies, common pitfalls, and encouragement]

Be prepared to be challenged and overwhelmed.

*Note: Switch to Academic mode for the formal treatment of this topic.*

It's common to start learning paths such as these with their root in technical domains like mathematics and computer science. This is sensible, but I think misses critical impacts of AI systems. I want to start with an ethics and ecology oriented approach first.

These prerequisites will ensure you can engage meaningfully with the interdisciplinary impact of AI technology, from understanding its technical content, challenges to human identity and supremacy, reflection .

## Cognitive Orientation

### Ethics
- Appreciation for value pluralism and moral uncertainty
- Comfort with moral disagreement and ethical complexity
- Ability to think about long-term and systemic consequences
- Understanding of power dynamics and distributive justice

### Critical Thinking Skills
- Epistemic humility
- Systems thinking and incentive analysis
- Willingness to challenge widely held beliefs and claims

### Learning and Meta-Learning
- **Epistemic resilience**: Comfort with confusion as part of learning
- **Interdisciplinary synthesis**: Connecting insights across domains

## Mathematical Foundations

<!-- ### Linear Algebra
- Vectors, matrices, and operations
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Matrix decomposition
- Understanding of high-dimensional spaces -->

<!-- ### Calculus
- Differentiation and integration
- Partial derivatives
- Chain rule (crucial for backpropagation)
- Basic optimization concepts -->

### Probability and Statistics
- Probability distributions
- Bayes' theorem
- Expectation and variance
- Statistical inference
- Understanding of uncertainty

## Programming Skills

### Python Proficiency
- Core Python programming
<!-- - NumPy for numerical computing -->

### Software Engineering Basics
- Version control (Git)
- Code organization and documentation
- Debugging skills
<!-- - Basic understanding of computational complexity -->

<!-- ## Recommended Resources

### Books
- "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop
- "The Alignment Problem" by Brian Christian
- "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville

### Online Courses
- Fast.ai courses for practical deep learning
- 3Blue1Brown for mathematical intuition
- MIT OCW for rigorous foundations

### Communities
- LessWrong for rationality and AI safety discussions
- Alignment Forum for technical AI safety content
- Local EA/AI safety reading groups -->

## Self-Assessment

Before proceeding, you should be comfortable with:
- [ ] Willing to read a machine learning paper and iteratively working on understanding
<!-- - [ ] Writing or quickly learning how to Python code -->
- [ ] Interested in thinking critically about the societal impacts of AI

Remember: You don't need to be an expert in all these areas, but having a working knowledge will significantly enhance your learning experience in AI safety research.
