## Safe AI Code Generation

Developing techniques to ensure AI systems generate safe, secure, and reliable code.

### Safety Challenges

-   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Preventing generation of exploitable code
-   **Logic Errors:** Ensuring correctness and avoiding subtle bugs
-   **Malicious Code:** Detecting and preventing harmful code generation
-   **Dependency Risks:** Managing external library and API usage

### Safety Techniques

-   Static analysis integration during generation
-   Sandboxed execution environments
-   Formal verification of generated code
-   Security pattern enforcement

### Control Mechanisms

-   Intent verification before generation
-   Output filtering and validation
-   Human-in-the-loop review systems
-   Capability restrictions by context

### Research Directions

-   Understanding code generation in LLMs
-   Adversarial code generation attacks
-   Safe exploration in programming environments
-   Automated testing of generated code
