## Formal Verification in AI Safety

Using mathematical methods to prove properties of AI systems with certainty.

### Verification Approaches

-   **Abstract Interpretation:** Over-approximating neural network behavior
-   **SMT Solving:** Encoding networks as satisfiability problems
-   **Interval Bound Propagation:** Computing output bounds
-   **Certified Defenses:** Provable robustness guarantees
