## Model Organisms of Misalignment

Deliberately creating AI systems with specific misalignment properties to study detection and mitigation strategies.

### Purpose and Methodology

-   **Controlled Study:** Create misalignment in controlled conditions
-   **Detection Research:** Test detection methods on known cases
-   **Mitigation Testing:** Evaluate interventions effectiveness
-   **Understanding Mechanisms:** Study how misalignment emerges

### Types of Model Organisms

-   Deceptively aligned models that hide capabilities
-   Reward hackers that exploit specification gaps
-   Power-seeking agents in simplified environments
-   Models that manipulate their training process

### Safety Considerations

-   Containment protocols for dangerous behaviors
-   Limiting capabilities while preserving phenomena
-   Ethical considerations in creating misaligned systems
-   Information security for techniques

### Research Applications

-   Benchmarking detection methods
-   Training robust monitors
-   Understanding failure modes
-   Developing safety interventions
