## Chain of Thought Analysis

Understanding when and how chain of thought reasoning is faithful to actual model computation.

### Core Concepts

-   **Faithfulness:** Whether CoT actually reflects model reasoning
-   **Post-hoc Rationalization:** When models generate plausible but unfaithful explanations
-   **Causal Influence:** Testing if CoT steps causally affect outputs
-   **Manipulation:** How CoT can be used to influence model behavior

### Analysis Techniques

-   Perturbation studies on reasoning chains
-   Comparing CoT with internal activations
-   Testing consistency across problem variations
-   Measuring correlation with model confidence

### Improvement Methods

-   Training for faithful reasoning
-   Reinforcement learning on verified chains
-   Multi-step verification procedures
-   Combining with interpretability tools
