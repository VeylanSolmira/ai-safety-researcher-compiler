# Basic Interpretability - Staring into the Void

Let me be honest: interpretability is like being a neuroscientist studying an alien brain. You poke at it, measure things, make pretty visualizations, and half the time you're not even sure if what you're seeing is real or just pareidolia in high-dimensional space.

## My Interpretability Journey (A Series of "WTF" Moments)

When I first tried interpretability, I printed out attention matrices. Stared at them for hours. You know what I learned? That I can't see patterns in 12x12 grids of decimals. Groundbreaking.

Then I made heatmaps. Beautiful, colorful heatmaps. I showed them to everyone. "Look!" I said, "The model is attending to important words!" Someone asked, "How do you know those words are actually important?" I didn't have a good answer.

That's when I realized: most interpretability is educated guessing with extra steps.

## What Interpretability Actually Is

**The Fantasy**: "We'll understand exactly how the model thinks!"
**The Reality**: "We can sometimes guess why it probably did that thing maybe."

Here's what interpretability actually gives you:
- Clues, not answers
- Correlations, not causation  
- Pretty pictures that might mean something
- Occasionally, genuinely useful insights

## The Techniques That Actually Work (Sometimes)

### 1. Attention Patterns (But Know Their Limits)

```python
def actually_useful_attention_viz(model, text):
    # Get attention weights
    attentions = get_attention_weights(model, text)
    
    # Here's the secret: MOST ATTENTION IS BORING
    # Early layers: positional patterns
    # Middle layers: syntactic patterns
    # Late layers: maybe semantic (maybe)
    
    # Only look at late layers
    late_attention = attentions[-3:].mean(0)  # Average last 3 layers
    
    # Ignore attention to special tokens
    late_attention[:, 0] = 0  # [CLS]
    late_attention[:, -1] = 0  # [SEP]
    
    # Now MAYBE you'll see something interesting
    return late_attention
```

What I learned: 90% of attention heads are doing boring grammatical stuff. The interesting ones are rare.

### 2. Activation Patching (Actually Useful!)

This is where interpretability gets real:

```python
def what_actually_matters(model, input_text, target_output):
    # Get clean run
    clean_activations = model.get_activations(input_text)
    clean_output = model(input_text)
    
    # Corrupt the input somehow
    corrupted_text = corrupt(input_text)
    corrupted_activations = model.get_activations(corrupted_text)
    
    importance_by_layer = {}
    
    for layer_idx in range(model.num_layers):
        # Patch in clean activations at this layer
        patched_output = model.run_with_patched_activation(
            corrupted_text, 
            layer_idx, 
            clean_activations[layer_idx]
        )
        
        # How much did this fix things?
        recovery = similarity(patched_output, clean_output)
        importance_by_layer[layer_idx] = recovery
    
    return importance_by_layer
```

This actually tells you which layers matter for specific behaviors!

### 3. The "Break Stuff and See" Method

My favorite approach:

```python
class BreakStuffInterpretability:
    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
        self.broken_things = []
    
    def break_attention_head(self, layer, head):
        # Zero out this attention head
        def hook(module, input, output):
            output[0, head, :, :] = 0
            return output
        
        handle = self.model.transformer.h[layer].attn.register_forward_hook(hook)
        return handle
    
    def what_breaks_when_i_break_this(self, layer, head, test_prompts):
        # Baseline performance
        baseline_outputs = [self.model(p) for p in test_prompts]
        
        # Break the head
        handle = self.break_attention_head(layer, head)
        broken_outputs = [self.model(p) for p in test_prompts]
        handle.remove()
        
        # What changed?
        changes = []
        for base, broken, prompt in zip(baseline_outputs, broken_outputs, test_prompts):
            if significantly_different(base, broken):
                changes.append({
                    'prompt': prompt,
                    'change': measure_change(base, broken)
                })
        
        return changes
```

If breaking something specific breaks something specific, you've learned something!

### 4. Probing (But Do It Right)

Everyone does probing wrong. Here's how to do it right:

```python
def probe_for_real_insights(model, texts, property_labels):
    all_layer_results = {}
    
    for layer_idx in range(model.num_layers):
        # Get representations
        reps = get_layer_representations(model, texts, layer_idx)
        
        # Train multiple probes with different regularization
        probes = []
        for C in [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0]:
            probe = LogisticRegression(C=C, max_iter=1000)
            scores = cross_val_score(probe, reps, property_labels, cv=5)
            probes.append((C, scores.mean()))
        
        # The story is in how probe performance changes with regularization
        all_layer_results[layer_idx] = probes
    
    # Plot probe performance across layers and regularization
    # If performance is high even with heavy regularization, the info is really there
    # If it needs low regularization, it might be overfitting
    
    return all_layer_results
```

## The Dirty Secrets of Interpretability

### Secret 1: Cherry-Picking is Rampant
People show you the one neuron that detects "dogs" and not the 10,000 that detect "vague texture pattern #3847"

### Secret 2: We Don't Know What We Don't Know
We might be completely missing the important stuff while staring at attention weights

### Secret 3: Scale Breaks Everything
That beautiful analysis on GPT-2? Good luck running it on GPT-4. Hope you have a supercomputer.

### Secret 4: Interpretability Can Lie
Models can learn to "look interpretable" while doing something completely different internally

## My Practical Interpretability Workflow

### Step 1: Start with Behavior
Don't dive into internals immediately. First:
- What does the model do?
- When does it fail?
- What patterns do you see?

### Step 2: Form Hypotheses
"I think the model is doing X because of Y"

### Step 3: Test Brutally
- If Y is true, breaking Z should change X
- If it doesn't, your hypothesis is wrong
- Most hypotheses are wrong

### Step 4: Triangulate
Never trust a single method:
- Attention says one thing
- Probing says another
- Activation patching says a third
- Truth is probably somewhere in the middle

## Tools That Actually Help

### My Interpretability Stack:
```python
# The essentials
import torch
import transformers
import transformer_lens  # Actually designed for interpretability
import circuitsvis  # Makes pretty pictures
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# My helper functions (built over years of pain)
def get_cache(model, prompt):
    """Get all activations in one go"""
    _, cache = model.run_with_cache(prompt)
    return cache

def patch_activation(model, clean_cache, corrupted_cache, layer, pos):
    """Patch specific activation"""
    def hook(activations, hook):
        activations[0, pos] = clean_cache[f'blocks.{layer}.hook_resid_post'][0, pos]
        return activations
    
    model.run_with_hooks(
        corrupted_prompt,
        fwd_hooks=[(f'blocks.{layer}.hook_resid_post', hook)]
    )
```

## What I Wish Someone Had Told Me

1. **Start Small**: Use GPT-2 small or even smaller models. You can actually understand those.

2. **Pick Specific Behaviors**: Don't try to "understand the model." Try to understand why it says "Paris" after "The capital of France is"

3. **Expect Confusion**: You'll be wrong 90% of the time. That's normal.

4. **Mechanistic > Statistical**: Understanding mechanisms beats correlation mining

5. **Share Negative Results**: Your failures help others avoid the same dead ends

## The Future of Interpretability (My Bets)

1. **Automated Interpretability**: AI systems explaining themselves (scary but necessary)
2. **Behavioral Focus**: Less "what are neurons doing" more "why does it behave this way"
3. **Standardization**: Finally agreeing on what "understanding" means
4. **Tool Renaissance**: Better tools making analysis accessible

## Your Assignment

Don't try to "interpret a model." Instead:

1. Pick ONE specific behavior (e.g., "model completes country capitals correctly")
2. Form ONE hypothesis about how it works
3. Design ONE experiment to test it
4. Run the experiment
5. Be wrong
6. Update your hypothesis
7. Repeat

## Final Thoughts

Interpretability is frustrating. You'll stare at matrices, make beautiful visualizations that mean nothing, and chase ghosts in high-dimensional spaces. 

But occasionally, just occasionally, you'll have that "aha!" moment where something clicks. Where you actually understand a tiny piece of how these alien minds work.

Those moments make it all worthwhile.

Welcome to interpretability. Prepare to be confused at increasingly sophisticated levels.

*P.S. - When you finally understand your first real circuit, you'll want to tell everyone. They won't care. Tell me instead - I'll get excited with you.*
