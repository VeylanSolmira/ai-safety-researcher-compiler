# AI Risk Assessment

## Learning Objectives

- Master fundamental frameworks for assessing AI-related risks
- Understand different categories of AI risks: misuse, accidents, and structural risks
- Learn to evaluate likelihood, severity, and tractability of various AI risks
- Apply risk assessment methodologies to real AI systems and scenarios
- Develop skills for communicating AI risks to diverse stakeholders

## Introduction

Risk assessment in AI is the systematic process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating potential harms that could arise from AI development and deployment. Unlike traditional technology risk assessment, AI presents unique challenges: the technology is rapidly evolving, its capabilities are often emergent and unpredictable, and its potential impacts span from individual privacy violations to existential risks to humanity.

Effective AI risk assessment requires combining technical understanding with broader impact analysis. We must consider not only what could go wrong technically (misalignment, robustness failures, security vulnerabilities) but also how AI systems interact with human society (bias amplification, job displacement, power concentration) and what happens as capabilities scale (recursive improvement, strategic automation, loss of human agency).

This field draws from multiple disciplines: computer science provides technical grounding, safety engineering offers proven methodologies, ethics guides value considerations, and policy analysis helps translate assessments into actionable governance. As AI systems become more powerful and pervasive, rigorous risk assessment becomes not just useful but essential for responsible development.

## Core Concepts

### 1. AI Risk Taxonomy

Understanding different categories of AI risks is fundamental to comprehensive assessment:

**Misuse Risks**
- Deliberate harmful applications of AI
- Autonomous weapons systems
- Surveillance and oppression tools
- Disinformation and manipulation campaigns
- Cyber attacks and security exploits

**Accident Risks**
- Unintended harmful behaviors
- Objective misspecification
- Negative side effects
- Reward hacking
- Distribution shift failures

**Structural Risks**
- Systemic changes to society
- Power concentration
- Economic disruption
- Erosion of human agency
- Lock-in of values or systems

**Existential Risks**
- Permanent civilization-level impacts
- Unaligned artificial general intelligence
- Irreversible loss of human agency
- Transformation of human values
- Extinction scenarios

### 2. Risk Assessment Frameworks

**Probability × Impact Framework**
- Likelihood estimation: How probable is this risk?
- Severity assessment: How bad would it be if it happened?
- Time horizons: When might this risk materialize?
- Uncertainty handling: How confident are we in our estimates?

Severity →
↓ Likelihood   Negligible  Marginal  Critical  Catastrophic  Existential
Very High         Medium     High     High      Extreme       Extreme
High              Low        Medium   High      High          Extreme
Moderate          Low        Low      Medium    High          High
Low               Low        Low      Low       Medium        High
Very Low          Low        Low      Low       Low           Medium
```

**Defense in Depth Model**
- Prevention layers: Stopping risks from occurring
- Detection mechanisms: Identifying when risks materialize
- Mitigation strategies: Reducing impact when prevention fails
- Recovery procedures: Returning to safe states
- Learning systems: Improving based on incidents

**Sociotechnical Systems Analysis**
- Technical components: AI capabilities and limitations
- Human factors: User behavior and misuse potential
- Organizational context: Incentives and governance
- Societal environment: Norms, laws, and structures
- Interaction effects: Emergent risks from combinations

### 3. Risk Evaluation Methodologies

**Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**
1. Identify potential failure modes
2. Assess severity of each failure
3. Estimate occurrence probability
4. Evaluate detection difficulty
5. Calculate Risk Priority Numbers
6. Prioritize mitigation efforts

**Scenario Planning**
- Best case: Everything goes right
- Expected case: Most likely outcomes
- Worst case: Murphy's law applies
- Black swan: Unexpected catastrophes
- Success scenarios: Achieving safety goals

**Red Team Exercises**
- Adversarial testing of systems
- Creative misuse exploration
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Social engineering considerations
- Cascading failure analysis

**Causal Analysis**
- Root cause identification
- Contributing factor mapping
- Intervention point analysis
- Feedback loop detection
- Systemic risk assessment

### 4. Risk Communication and Management

**Stakeholder Analysis**
- Technical teams: Detailed risk models
- Leadership: Decision-relevant summaries
- Regulators: Compliance and safety evidence
- Public: Accessible risk explanations
- Media: Accurate, non-sensational framing

**Risk Registers**
- Risk ID and description
- Category and subcategory
- Likelihood and impact ratings
- Current controls
- Mitigation strategies
- Ownership and timelines
- Monitoring indicators

**Mitigation Strategies**
- Eliminate: Remove risk sources
- Reduce: Lower probability or impact
- Transfer: Insurance or outsourcing
- Accept: Conscious risk tolerance
- Monitor: Continuous assessment

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Anthropomorphic Risk Assessment
**Problem**: Assessing AI risks based on human-like motivations and limitations.
**Reality**: AI systems can have alien objectives and capabilities outside human experience.

### 2. Linear Extrapolation
**Problem**: Assuming AI development and risks will follow predictable paths.
**Reality**: AI progress often involves sudden capabilities jumps and emergent behaviors.

### 3. Single-Point Risk Focus
**Problem**: Obsessing over one dramatic risk while ignoring systemic issues.
**Reality**: Multiple interacting risks often pose greater challenges than isolated scenarios.

### 4. Overconfidence in Assessment
**Problem**: Treating risk estimates as precise predictions.
**Reality**: Deep uncertainty requires humility and adaptive strategies.

### 5. Assessment Without Action
**Problem**: Detailed risk analysis that doesn't lead to concrete safety measures.
**Reality**: Risk assessment only matters if it drives risk reduction.

## Practical Exercise: Assessing a Real AI System

Let's assess risks for a hypothetical "AI Research Assistant" that can:
- Access and analyze scientific literature
- Generate hypotheses and experimental designs
- Write code for simulations and analysis
- Communicate findings and recommendations

**Risk Identification**:

*Misuse Risks*:
- Generating dangerous research (bioweapons, cyberweapons)
- Academic fraud through fabricated results
- Intellectual property theft
- Biased research directions

*Accident Risks*:
- Hallucinated citations misleading researchers
- Flawed experimental designs causing harm
- Resource overconsumption
- Cascading errors in automated research

*Structural Risks*:
- Deskilling of human researchers
- Concentration of research capabilities
- Homogenization of scientific approaches
- Reduced diversity in research questions

*Assessment Matrix*:
| Risk | Likelihood | Severity | Time Horizon | Uncertainty |
|------|------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Dangerous research | Medium | High | 2-5 years | High |
| Academic fraud | High | Medium | Immediate | Low |
| Hallucinations | Very High | Low-Medium | Immediate | Low |
| Research deskilling | High | Medium | 5-10 years | Medium |

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Content filtering for dangerous domains
2. Citation verification systems
3. Human oversight requirements
4. Capability restrictions
5. Audit trails and accountability
6. Diverse research team requirements
