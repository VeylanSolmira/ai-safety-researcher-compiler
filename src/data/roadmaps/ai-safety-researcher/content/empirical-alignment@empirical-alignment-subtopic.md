## Empirical Alignment Research

Hands-on implementation and testing of state-of-the-art alignment techniques.

### RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

-   **Supervised Fine-tuning:** Initial behavior cloning from demonstrations
-   **Reward Model Training:** Learning human preferences from comparisons
-   **PPO Optimization:** Reinforcement learning against reward model
-   **KL Penalties:** Preventing mode collapse and maintaining diversity

### Constitutional AI

-   **Principle-Based Training:** Encoding values as constitutional principles
-   **Self-Critique:** Models evaluate their own outputs
-   **Revision Training:** Learning to improve based on critiques
-   **Reduced Human Feedback:** Scaling oversight through AI assistance
