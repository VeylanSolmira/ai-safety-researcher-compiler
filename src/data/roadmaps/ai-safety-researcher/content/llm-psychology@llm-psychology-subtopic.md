## LLM Psychology

Studying the behavioral patterns and internal states of language models through conversational probing.

### Key Approaches

-   **Conversational Probing:** Systematic questioning to reveal model knowledge and beliefs
-   **Consistency Testing:** Checking coherence across related queries
-   **Behavioral Patterns:** Identifying systematic biases and tendencies
-   **Self-Report Analysis:** Evaluating model claims about its own processes

### Research Questions

-   What can models reliably report about their internal states?
-   How do conversational contexts affect model behavior?
-   Can we detect deception through behavioral analysis?
-   What psychological frameworks apply to LLMs?

### Applications

-   Safety evaluation through behavioral testing
-   Understanding model capabilities and limitations
-   Detecting potential misalignment
-   Improving human-AI interaction
