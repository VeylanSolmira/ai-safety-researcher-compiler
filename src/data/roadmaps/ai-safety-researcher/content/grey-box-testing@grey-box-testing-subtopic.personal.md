# Grey Box Testing: The Art of Testing with Partial Knowledge

Alright, let's talk about grey box testing - the testing approach that actually reflects reality for most of us. You know how in theory you're supposed to have either complete access (white box) or no access (black box) to a system? Yeah, that's cute. In practice, you're usually somewhere in between, squinting at API docs, reverse-engineering behaviors, and making educated guesses about what's going on inside.

## My Grey Box Journey

I used to think grey box testing was just "black box testing with extra steps" until I actually started doing it seriously. The first time I had access to model logits instead of just predictions, it was like someone turned on a light in a dark room. Suddenly I could see confidence scores, uncertainty patterns, decision boundaries... it completely changed how I approached testing.

The real "aha" moment came when testing a production recommendation system. We had:
- API access with confidence scores
- High-level architecture docs (3 layers outdated, naturally)
- Some metadata about training data
- Zero access to actual weights or internals

Classic grey box situation. And you know what? We found more vulnerabilities in that system than in any pure black or white box test I'd done before.

## The Grey Box Spectrum

Here's something they don't tell you in textbooks: grey box testing isn't binary. It's a whole spectrum of "how much can I see?"

**The Minimalist Grey Box**: You've got API access that returns probabilities instead of just labels. That's it. But even this tiny window is gold - you can map confidence surfaces, find decision boundaries, identify uncertain regions.

**The Architecture Archaeologist**: Someone gives you a 6-month-old architecture diagram. Half the layers have changed, but the general structure is there. Time to design tests that exploit architectural patterns rather than specific implementations.

**The Gradient Whisperer**: You can compute input gradients but nothing else. It's like having x-ray vision for sensitivity - you can see exactly where the model is paying attention, even if you don't know why.

**The Layer Peeker**: Access to some intermediate representations. Maybe you can see embeddings, maybe attention weights. Each layer output is a clue about what the model is really doing.

## Real-World Grey Box Hacks

### The Confidence Game

One of my favorite grey box techniques exploits confidence scores. Here's a dirty secret: most models are terribly calibrated. They'll return 99.9% confidence on completely ambiguous inputs.

I once tested a sentiment analysis API that returned confidence scores. By binary searching the input space, I could find inputs where the model was maximally uncertain (50/50 confidence). These boundary cases? Almost always broken in interesting ways.

```python
def find_decision_boundary(api, text1, text2, tolerance=0.01):
    """The poor person's decision boundary finder"""
    # Assuming text1 and text2 have different predictions
    while True:
        mid_text = interpolate_text(text1, text2, 0.5)  # Yeah, text interpolation is weird
        conf = api.get_confidence(mid_text)
        
        if abs(conf - 0.5) < tolerance:
            return mid_text  # Found the boundary!
            
        if conf > 0.5:
            text1 = mid_text
        else:
            text2 = mid_text
```

### Architecture-Aware Fuzzing

When you know the architecture, you can craft inputs that stress specific components. Testing a CNN? Throw frequency patterns at it. Transformer? Mess with positional encodings. 

I learned this the hard way testing a vision transformer. Random pixel noise? Model didn't care. But shift all patches by one position? Complete meltdown. Architecture knowledge is power.

### The Gradient Treasure Map

Even basic gradient access turns you into a vulnerability archaeologist. Gradients show you exactly where the model is sensitive. It's like having a "weak spots" map.

My favorite trick: compute gradients for correctly classified samples, then perturb *only* the high-gradient regions. Way more efficient than random fuzzing, and you find the weird stuff faster.

## Grey Box Philosophy

Here's what I've learned about grey box testing over the years:

**Use What You've Got**: Don't cry about not having full white box access. Even tiny amounts of information can dramatically improve your testing. That outdated architecture diagram? Still useful. Those confidence scores? Gold mine.

**Layer Your Approaches**: Start with black box baselines, then layer on grey box techniques based on available info. Each piece of information should make your tests more targeted, not replace your existing approach.

**Information Decay**: Grey box information has a half-life. That architecture doc from 6 months ago? Probably 50% wrong. But 50% right is still better than 0%. Just don't trust it blindly.

**The Sweet Spot**: Sometimes grey box is actually better than white box. With full access, you can get lost in the details. With partial access, you focus on what matters - the behaviors and patterns that transcend implementation details.

## War Stories

### The Case of the Leaked Logits

We were testing a competitor's API (ethically, with permission!) that accidentally leaked raw logits in their JSON response. They thought they were only returning top-5 predictions, but the full logit vector was sitting right there in the response.

With those logits, we could:
- Map the entire output space
- Find adversarial examples trivially
- Identify training data biases
- Even partially reconstruct the model behavior

They fixed it after our report, but for a few weeks, their "black box" API was more like a glass box.

### The Architecture Time Machine

Best grey box situation ever: testing a model where we had the architecture from version 1, but they were on version 3. Changes between versions? Mostly just layer sizes and some normalization tweaks.

We designed tests assuming the v1 architecture and found that 80% of them still found bugs in v3. Turns out, fundamental architectural choices create lasting vulnerabilities. That residual connection you added in v1? Still attackable in v3.

## Practical Tips

**Start with Reconnaissance**: Before testing, spend time figuring out exactly what information you have access to. Query the API extensively. Read all docs. Sometimes you have more grey box info than you realize.

**Build Information-Specific Tools**: Don't use generic testing tools. If you have gradient access, build gradient-specific fuzzers. If you have confidence scores, build confidence-based explorers.

**Cache Everything**: Grey box testing often involves lots of queries. Cache results aggressively. That confidence score you computed? Save it. You'll want it later.

**Think Like a Reverse Engineer**: Grey box testing is part testing, part detective work. Every output is a clue. Every behavior tells you something about the internals.

**Document Your Assumptions**: When you're making educated guesses based on partial info, write them down. When tests fail, it's often because an assumption was wrong.

## The Grey Box Mindset

The best grey box testers I know share a certain mindset:
- Comfortable with uncertainty
- Creative about information use
- Persistent in reconnaissance
- Skeptical of documentation
- Always looking for information leaks

It's like being a detective where you can see some evidence but not all of it. You have to be clever about using what you've got.

## My Testing Stack

For grey box testing, I've settled on this toolkit:

1. **Reconnaissance Suite**: Scripts to probe APIs and discover available information
2. **Confidence Mapper**: Tools for exploring decision boundaries via confidence scores
3. **Architecture Guesser**: Patterns to infer architecture from behavior
4. **Gradient Explorer**: Targeted fuzzing using gradient information
5. **Cache Manager**: Because re-querying is expensive and slow

## Final Thoughts

Grey box testing is where the rubber meets the road in AI safety. It's not as clean as white box, not as general as black box, but it's what you'll actually be doing most of the time.

The key is to be opportunistic. Every bit of information is an advantage. That API that returns processing time? Use it to infer model complexity. That error message that mentions layer names? Now you know something about architecture.

Remember: in the real world, perfect information is rare. Grey box testing is about making the most of imperfect information. And honestly? That makes it more fun. It's like solving a puzzle where you have some pieces but not all of them.

So embrace the grey. Use what you've got. Be creative. And always, always cache your results - future you will thank present you when you need to re-analyze something.

Happy testing in the shadows! üîç
