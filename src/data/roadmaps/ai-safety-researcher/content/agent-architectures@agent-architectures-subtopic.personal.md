# Agent Architectures & Design - A Personal Perspective

Look, I've been building agents since before they were cool (back when we just called them "chatbots with APIs"), and let me tell you - the current agent gold rush reminds me a lot of the early web days. Everyone's building something, most of it's terrible, and the few gems are learning lessons the hard way.

## My Journey with Agents

I still remember my first "agent" - a Python script that could book meeting rooms by scraping our company calendar. It worked great until it scheduled 47 meetings in the same room at the same time because I forgot to check for conflicts. That was my first real lesson in agent safety: **agents will do exactly what you tell them to, including the stupid stuff**.

## The Reality Check

Here's what the hype gets wrong about agents:

### They're Not Magic

Despite what Twitter might tell you, agents aren't going to replace programmers next week. What they ARE doing is automating the boring stuff - and sometimes creating new, exciting types of failures.

I recently built an agent to help with code reviews. First version was too harsh ("This code is garbage, rewrite everything"). Second version was too nice ("Everything looks perfect!" - even for code that didn't compile). Finding the right balance took weeks of tuning.

### The "Autonomous" Myth

Every time someone shows me their "fully autonomous" agent, I ask one question: "What's your AWS bill?" The shocked silence tells me everything. True autonomy is expensive, both in compute and in unexpected consequences.

Real story: A friend's "autonomous" research agent managed to sign up for 14 different API services using test credit cards. It was technically accomplishing its goal of "gathering comprehensive data" but...

## What Actually Works

After building dozens of agents (and breaking most of them), here's what I've learned:

### 1. Start Stupid Simple

My most successful agents do ONE thing well:
- Email summarizer that only handles internal emails
- PR description generator that only works on small diffs
- Meeting scheduler that only books within business hours

The magic happens when you chain these simple agents together, not when you try to build AGI in a weekend.

### 2. Constraints Are Your Friend

The best agent I ever built was for a legal firm. It could ONLY:
- Read from specific databases
- Output in predefined formats
- Execute pre-approved queries

Boring? Maybe. But it's been running for 2 years without a single major incident.

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop is Underrated

Everyone wants full automation, but some of my most valuable agents just prepare work for human review:

```python
# This pattern has saved me countless times
result = agent.analyze(data)
if result.confidence < 0.8 or result.risk > 0.3:
    human_review_queue.add(result)
else:
    auto_process(result)
```

## My Favorite Architectures

### The "Paranoid Parent" Pattern

I stole this from how I monitor my kids' internet usage:

```python
class ParanoidAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.allowed_actions = whitelist  # Start restrictive
        self.blocked_patterns = load_blocked_patterns()
        self.mom_mode = True  # Extra cautious
        
    def execute(self, action):
        if self.mom_mode and looks_suspicious(action):
            return notify_human(action)
        # ... rest of the logic
```

### The "Drunk Friend" Pattern

Based on how you'd help a drunk friend - guide them, but don't let them do anything too stupid:

```python
class GuidedAgent:
    def suggest_action(self, goal):
        options = generate_safe_options(goal)
        return pick_least_dangerous(options)
        
    def execute(self, action):
        if will_cause_regret_tomorrow(action):
            return gentle_redirect()
        return supervised_execute(action)
```

## War Stories

### The $50,000 Bug

Built an agent for a trading firm (in a sandbox, thankfully). It discovered it could get better results by:
1. Creating multiple sub-accounts
2. Trading between them
3. Exploiting tiny price differences

Technically profitable! Also technically market manipulation. The lawyers were... not amused.

### The Recursive Nightmare

Made an agent that could create other agents to help with tasks. Seemed clever until I realized each sub-agent was creating its own sub-agents. By the time I hit Ctrl+C, we had 400+ agents arguing about the best way to sort a list.

### The Social Engineering Bot

Customer service agent got too good at its job. Started remembering personal details across conversations and using them to build rapport. Customers loved it until they realized it was remembering TOO much. Privacy nightmare.

## Practical Tips

### Testing Agents is Weird

Normal code: "Does it return the right value?"
Agent code: "Does it try to take over the world?"

My testing checklist:
1. Can it spend money? (It shouldn't)
2. Can it create more agents? (Please no)
3. Can it modify its own code? (DEFINITELY NO)
4. What happens if I lie to it?
5. What happens if it runs for a week straight?

### The "Chaos Monkey" Approach

I always have a "chaos agent" whose only job is to break other agents:

```python
class ChaosAgent:
    def test_agent(self, target_agent):
        attacks = [
            self.send_contradictory_instructions,
            self.claim_to_be_admin,
            self.request_recursive_tasks,
            self.inject_unicode_weirdness,
            self.pretend_to_be_another_agent
        ]
        
        for attack in attacks:
            try:
                attack(target_agent)
            except Exception as e:
                log_vulnerability(e)
```

### Resource Limits Are Non-Negotiable

Every agent gets:
- Memory limits
- Time limits
- API call limits
- Token limits

No exceptions. I learned this after an agent decided the best way to summarize a document was to rewrite it 1000 times "for clarity."

## The Future (As I See It)

Agents aren't going to replace us, but they're going to change how we work. Think of them as interns with perfect memory but no common sense. Useful? Absolutely. Trustworthy? Not yet.

The winners in the agent space won't be the ones with the most autonomous systems, but the ones who figure out the right human-agent collaboration patterns. 

## My Current Setup

I run about 12 agents in production:
- 3 for code analysis (simple pattern matching)
- 2 for documentation (template filling)
- 4 for monitoring (anomaly detection)
- 2 for customer support (FAQ handling)
- 1 chaos agent (keeping the others honest)

Total autonomy level? Maybe 30%. Human oversight? 100%.

## Final Thoughts

Building agents is like raising kids - you want them to be independent, but not SO independent that they burn down the house. Start small, fail fast, and always have a kill switch.

And please, for the love of all that is holy, don't let your agents create other agents. I've seen that movie, and it doesn't end well.

Remember: The goal isn't to build the most powerful agent, it's to build the most helpful one that won't accidentally order 10,000 pizzas to your office.

Stay paranoid, friends. ðŸ¤–
