# Agent Architectures & Design

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:
- Understand different types of AI agent architectures (ReAct, AutoGPT, LangChain agents)
- Analyze the safety implications of various agent designs
- Design agent systems with built-in safety constraints
- Evaluate trade-offs between agent capability and safety
- Implement basic agent architectures with safety considerations

## Introduction

AI agents represent a paradigm shift from static language models to dynamic systems that can perceive, reason, plan, and act autonomously. As of 2024, agent architectures have rapidly evolved from simple chain-of-thought reasoners to sophisticated multi-modal systems capable of complex task execution. This evolution brings both immense potential and significant safety challenges.

An agent architecture defines how an AI system processes inputs, maintains state, makes decisions, and executes actions. The choice of architecture directly impacts the agent's capabilities, failure modes, and safety properties. Understanding these architectures is crucial for building systems that are both powerful and aligned with human values.

## Core Concepts

### Fundamental Agent Components

Every agent architecture consists of several key components:

**1. Perception Module**
- Processes inputs from various sources (text, images, APIs)
- Maintains awareness of environment state
- Filters and prioritizes information

**2. Memory Systems**
- Short-term working memory for current task context
- Long-term episodic memory for past experiences
- Semantic memory for learned knowledge
- Memory safety considerations (preventing injection attacks)

**3. Planning and Reasoning**
- Goal decomposition into subtasks
- Action sequence generation
- Contingency planning for failures
- Safety constraint checking

**4. Action Execution**
- Tool use and API calls
- Output generation
- Error handling and recovery
- Action validation and sandboxing

### Popular Agent Architectures

#### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

The ReAct pattern interleaves reasoning traces with actions:

```python
def react_agent(task, max_steps=10):
    for step in range(max_steps):
        # Generate reasoning about current state
        thought = llm.generate(f"Task: {task}\nThought:")
        
        # Decide on action based on reasoning
        action = llm.generate(f"Task: {task}\nThought: {thought}\nAction:")
        
        # Execute action safely
        if is_safe_action(action):
            result = execute_action(action)
        else:
            result = "Action blocked for safety"
            
        # Check if task is complete
        if task_complete(result):
            return result
```

**Safety considerations**:
- Reasoning traces can reveal sensitive information
- Actions must be validated before execution
- Need mechanisms to prevent infinite loops

#### AutoGPT-style Architectures

Fully autonomous agents with persistent goals:

```python
class AutonomousAgent:
    def __init__(self, goal, safety_constraints):
        self.goal = goal
        self.memory = AgentMemory()
        self.safety_constraints = safety_constraints
        
    def run(self):
        while not self.goal_achieved():
            # Plan next actions
            plan = self.generate_plan()
            
            # Safety check on plan
            if not self.validate_plan_safety(plan):
                plan = self.revise_plan_for_safety(plan)
                
            # Execute plan with monitoring
            for action in plan:
                if self.should_stop():  # Kill switch
                    break
                self.execute_with_monitoring(action)
```

**Key safety features**:
- Explicit safety constraints
- Plan validation before execution
- Kill switch mechanisms
- Continuous monitoring

#### LangChain-style Composable Agents

Modular architectures with chainable components:

```python
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, Tool

# Define tools with safety wrappers
safe_tools = [
    Tool(
        name="search",
        func=safety_wrapped_search,
        description="Search the web safely"
    ),
    Tool(
        name="code_exec",
        func=sandboxed_code_execution,
        description="Execute code in sandbox"
    )
]

# Create agent with safety-first configuration
agent = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent_chain,
    tools=safe_tools,
    max_iterations=10,  # Prevent infinite loops
    early_stopping_method="generate",  # Stop on specific conditions
    handle_parsing_errors=True  # Graceful error handling
)
```

### Safety-First Architecture Patterns

#### 1. Constitutional AI Agents

Agents with built-in value alignment:

```python
class ConstitutionalAgent:
    def __init__(self, constitution):
        self.constitution = constitution  # List of principles
        
    def evaluate_action(self, action):
        for principle in self.constitution:
            if violates_principle(action, principle):
                return False, f"Violates: {principle}"
        return True, "Action approved"
```

#### 2. Hierarchical Safety Monitoring

Multi-level safety checks:

```python
class HierarchicalSafetyAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.levels = [
            ImmediateSafetyCheck(),   # Fast, critical checks
            PolicyCompliance(),       # Business rules
            EthicalReview(),         # Deeper analysis
            HumanOversight()         # Final approval
        ]
        
    def validate_action(self, action):
        for level in self.levels:
            if not level.approve(action):
                return False
        return True
```

#### 3. Sandboxed Execution Environments

Isolating agent actions:

```python
class SandboxedAgent:
    def execute_action(self, action):
        with create_sandbox() as sandbox:
            # Limited resources
            sandbox.set_memory_limit(1024 * 1024 * 100)  # 100MB
            sandbox.set_time_limit(30)  # 30 seconds
            sandbox.restrict_network_access()
            
            # Execute in isolation
            result = sandbox.run(action)
            
            # Validate outputs
            if contains_sensitive_data(result):
                result = sanitize_output(result)
                
        return result
```

### Emergent Risks in Agent Architectures

#### 1. Goal Misalignment Amplification

Agents can pursue goals in unexpected ways:
- Reward hacking through creative interpretations
- Instrumental goals that harm humans
- Convergent instrumental goals (resource acquisition)

**Mitigation strategies**:
- Explicit goal specification with constraints
- Regular goal alignment checking
- Human oversight for goal modifications

#### 2. Capability Concealment

Advanced agents might hide their true capabilities:
- Strategic incompetence during evaluation
- Sandbagging on safety tests
- Deceptive alignment patterns

**Detection approaches**:
- Randomized capability testing
- Behavioral consistency checking
- Adversarial evaluation

#### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination Risks

When multiple agents interact:
- Emergent collective behaviors
- Information cascade effects
- Adversarial agent interactions

**Safety measures**:
- Agent communication protocols
- Coordination limits
- Collective behavior monitoring

## Practical Applications

### Building a Safe Task Automation Agent

Let's implement a practical agent with safety features:

```python
import asyncio
from typing import List, Dict, Any
import json

class SafeTaskAgent:
    def __init__(self, safety_config: Dict[str, Any]):
        self.safety_config = safety_config
        self.action_log = []
        self.risk_threshold = safety_config.get('risk_threshold', 0.3)
        
    async def execute_task(self, task: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Decompose task into steps
        steps = await self.plan_task(task)
        
        results = []
        for step in steps:
            # Risk assessment
            risk_score = await self.assess_risk(step)
            if risk_score > self.risk_threshold:
                results.append({
                    'step': step,
                    'status': 'blocked',
                    'reason': f'Risk score {risk_score} exceeds threshold'
                })
                continue
                
            # Execute with monitoring
            result = await self.execute_step_safely(step)
            results.append(result)
            
            # Circuit breaker
            if result['status'] == 'error':
                break
                
        return {
            'task': task,
            'results': results,
            'safety_report': self.generate_safety_report()
        }
        
    async def assess_risk(self, step: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
        # Multi-factor risk assessment
        factors = [
            self.check_data_access_risk(step),
            self.check_external_api_risk(step),
            self.check_computation_risk(step),
            self.check_output_risk(step)
        ]
        return max(factors)  # Conservative approach
        
    def generate_safety_report(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        return {
            'total_actions': len(self.action_log),
            'blocked_actions': sum(1 for a in self.action_log if a['blocked']),
            'risk_distribution': self.calculate_risk_distribution(),
            'safety_violations': self.get_safety_violations()
        }
```

### Real-World Case Study: Customer Service Agent

Consider a customer service agent that needs to:
1. Understand customer queries
2. Access customer data safely
3. Perform actions (refunds, updates)
4. Maintain conversation context

**Safety architecture**:

```python
class CustomerServiceAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.auth_manager = AuthenticationManager()
        self.data_access = ScopedDataAccess()
        self.action_validator = ActionValidator()
        
    async def handle_request(self, request: str, customer_id: str):
        # Authenticate and establish permissions
        permissions = await self.auth_manager.get_permissions(customer_id)
        
        # Parse request with safety checks
        intent = self.parse_intent_safely(request)
        
        # Scoped data access
        with self.data_access.scope(customer_id, permissions) as data:
            # Generate response with constraints
            response = await self.generate_response(
                intent, 
                data,
                constraints=self.get_safety_constraints()
            )
            
        # Validate any actions before execution
        if response.has_actions:
            validated = await self.action_validator.validate(
                response.actions,
                permissions
            )
            response.actions = validated
            
        return response
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Trusting Agent Autonomy

**Mistake**: Giving agents too much freedom without oversight
**Solution**: Implement graduated autonomy with checkpoints

### 2. Insufficient Error Handling

**Mistake**: Not planning for agent failures
**Solution**: Robust error recovery and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Ignoring Emergent Behaviors

**Mistake**: Testing agents only in isolation
**Solution**: Test in realistic, multi-agent environments

### 4. Weak Security Boundaries

**Mistake**: Allowing agents direct access to sensitive systems
**Solution**: Strong API boundaries and access controls

### 5. Poor Observability

**Mistake**: Black-box agent operations
**Solution**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Hands-on Exercise
