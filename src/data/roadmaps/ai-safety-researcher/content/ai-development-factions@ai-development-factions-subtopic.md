# AI Development Factions & Paradigm Analysis

## Learning Objectives

- Map major AI development organizations to their dominant paradigmatic frameworks
- Analyze the gap between paradigm importance and actual representation in the field
- Understand how organizational paradigms shape AI development trajectories
- Identify critical missing perspectives in current AI development
- Apply paradigm analysis to predict and influence AI futures

## Introduction

The development of artificial intelligence is not happening in a vacuum - it's being shaped by organizations with specific worldviews, incentives, and conceptual frameworks. This topic examines how major AI development entities operate under different paradigmatic frameworks, revealing both the diversity and concerning gaps in how we collectively think about AI.

Understanding these paradigmatic positions is crucial for several reasons. First, paradigms shape what questions get asked, what solutions get explored, and what risks get ignored. Second, the dominance of certain paradigms (like "The Race") and absence of others (like "Symbiogenesis") may be creating the very risks we fear. Third, strategic intervention at the paradigm level may be more effective than technical solutions alone.

This analysis reveals a troubling concentration in competitive, adversarial, and control-based paradigms while showing a desperate lack of ecological, symbiotic, and balance-based thinking. By mapping this landscape, we can identify where paradigm interventions are most urgently needed.

### 3. **Humanities/Arts**
Aesthetic, narrative, and meaning-making paradigms completely missing from technical development.

### 4. **Disabled Communities**
Symbiotic/augmentation paradigms from disability justice perspective absent.

### 5. **Children/Future Generations**
No paradigms centering the interests of those who will inherit AI systems.

## Conclusion: The Paradigm Emergency

The current AI development landscape shows a dangerous concentration in competitive, adversarial, and control-based paradigms while desperately lacking ecological, symbiotic, and balance-based thinking. This paradigm poverty creates existential risk not through technical failure but through conceptual failure.

**Most Critical Interventions:**
1. **Inject symbiotic paradigms** into every major AI lab immediately
2. **Develop ecological governance** frameworks for AI systems
3. **Create balance metrics** that become as important as capability metrics
4. **Dramatically expand** who gets to shape AI paradigms

The gap analysis reveals we're building AI with the conceptual equivalent of only having hammers when we need an entire toolkit. The missing paradigms aren't just "nice to have" – they may contain the only viable paths to beneficial AI futures.

The entities currently shaping AI are trapped in paradigms that may be self-defeating. Without immediate paradigm diversification, we risk creating the very futures we fear simply because we couldn't imagine alternatives.

## Practical Exercise: Paradigm Influence Mapping

Select an AI development decision (e.g., open-sourcing models, safety testing requirements, international cooperation) and analyze how different paradigms would approach it:

1. **Identify stakeholders** and their dominant paradigms
2. **Predict positions** based on paradigmatic thinking
3. **Find paradigm bridges** that could enable agreement
4. **Design interventions** that shift paradigmatic framing
5. **Test robustness** against paradigm lock-in
