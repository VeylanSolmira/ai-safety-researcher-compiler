## Machine Learning Paradigms

Understanding different learning paradigms is crucial for identifying safety risks.

### Supervised Learning

-   Learning from labeled examples
-   Classification vs regression
-   Training, validation, and test sets
-   Safety risks: Distribution shift, adversarial examples

### Unsupervised Learning

-   Finding patterns without labels
-   Clustering and dimensionality reduction
-   Autoencoders and representation learning
-   Safety risks: Hidden biases, unexpected clusters

### Reinforcement Learning

-   Learning through interaction
-   Reward functions and policies
-   Exploration vs exploitation
-   Safety risks: Reward hacking, unsafe exploration
