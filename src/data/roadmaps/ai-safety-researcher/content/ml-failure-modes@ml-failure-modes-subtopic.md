## Understanding ML Failure Modes

Recognizing how ML systems fail is crucial for building safer AI.

### Overfitting and Underfitting

-   Memorization vs generalization
-   Bias-variance tradeoff
-   Regularization techniques
-   Safety implications of poor generalization

### Distribution Shift

-   Training vs deployment distributions
-   Covariate shift and concept drift
-   Out-of-distribution detection
-   Robustness to distributional changes

### Other Critical Failures

-   Adversarial examples and robustness
-   Spurious correlations and shortcuts
-   Catastrophic forgetting
-   Reward hacking in RL systems

### Mitigation Strategies

-   Robust training techniques
-   Uncertainty estimation
-   Safe deployment practices
-   Monitoring and detection systems
