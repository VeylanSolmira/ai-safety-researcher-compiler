# Key Figures in AI Safety - Personal Take

**ðŸ’­ Personal Opinion**: This is my honest assessment of key figures in AI safety. These views are subjective and meant to help you understand the field's dynamics beyond the official narratives.

## The Titans

### Stuart Russell
**My Take**: Russell is the field's diplomatic face - bringing academic credibility without the "doom and gloom." His "Human Compatible" framework is elegant but perhaps too optimistic about our ability to specify human values.

**Strengths**: 
- Made AI safety respectable in mainstream AI
- Clear communicator who avoids hyperbole
- Actually understands both classical AI and modern ML

**Limitations**: 
- Sometimes too diplomatic - pulls punches on timeline concerns
- Value alignment framing might be fundamentally flawed

### Eliezer Yudkowsky
**My Take**: Love him or hate him, Yudkowsky created this field. Yes, he can be abrasive and overconfident, but he was right about many things decades before others caught on.

**Strengths**:
- Visionary who saw alignment problems before anyone
- Uncompromising intellectual honesty
- Created conceptual foundations others build on

**Limitations**:
- Communication style alienates potential allies
- Pessimism might be self-defeating
- Sometimes too wedded to his original ideas

**Hot Take**: The field owes him more credit than it gives. Many "novel" ideas are just his concepts repackaged.

### Paul Christiano
**My Take**: The most technically sophisticated alignment researcher. His work is dense but groundbreaking. IDA might be our best shot at scalable alignment.

**Strengths**:
- Bridges theory and practice better than anyone
- Actually engages with ML reality
- Humble despite brilliance

**Concerns**:
- Work is often too abstract for implementation
- May be too optimistic about prosaic alignment

### Dario Amodei
**My Take**: The most powerful person in AI safety. Anthropic could be our best hope or biggest disappointment. Jury's still out.

**Strengths**:
- Actually building safer AI systems
- Attracted top talent to safety
- Constitutional AI is genuinely innovative

**Concerns**:
- Still racing to build AGI
- "Responsible scaling" might be an oxymoron
- Corporate incentives will eventually conflict with safety

## The Controversy Corner

### Geoffrey Hinton
**My Take**: His "conversion" to AI safety was important for mainstream credibility, but I'm skeptical. Feels like too little, too late from someone who helped create the problem.

**Reality Check**: He's learning in public, which is admirable, but his technical contributions to safety are minimal. More of a spokesperson than researcher now.

### Yoshua Bengio
**My Take**: Similar to Hinton but more genuine. Actually trying to contribute technically, not just give scary interviews. His work on causal reasoning could be important.

### Yann LeCun
**Not technically safety-focused, but worth mentioning**: The anti-safety voice among the deep learning pioneers. His dismissal of x-risk concerns is intellectually lazy and potentially dangerous. History won't be kind to his stance.

## The Rising Stars You Should Actually Follow

### Neel Nanda
**My Take**: Making interpretability accessible is huge. Yes, he's sometimes overly optimistic about mech interp, but he's training the next generation.

**Why He Matters**: Built a community, not just research. That's rare and valuable.

### Victoria Krakovna
**My Take**: Underrated. Her specification gaming work is some of the most practical safety research. DeepMind's safety team punches above its weight because of people like her.

### Buck Shlegeris (Redwood)
**My Take**: Redwood is doing the unglamorous work that actually matters. Buck's willingness to pivot and kill projects that don't work is refreshing.

## The Governance People

### Helen Toner
**My Take**: The OpenAI board drama showed governance isn't ready for prime time. She was probably right about whatever concerns she had, but execution matters.

### Allan Dafoe
**My Take**: Doing important work, but international cooperation on AI might be a fantasy. Still, someone needs to try.

## Who's Missing from Most Lists

### Connor Leahy (EleutherAI/Conjecture)
Controversial but important. Built open models then pivoted to safety. His pessimism is data-driven.

### Ought/Elicit Team
Doing practical alignment work without the hype. Andreas StuhlmÃ¼ller doesn't get enough credit.

### Independent Researchers
- John Wentworth: Best work on natural abstractions
- Steve Byrnes: Brain-like AGI safety
- Vanessa Kosoy: Mathematical foundations

## My Honest Assessment

**The Good**:
- The field has real talent now
- Moving from philosophy to engineering
- Some genuine progress on interpretability

**The Bad**:
- Too much groupthink in the Bay Area
- Racing dynamics are winning
- Governance is 10 years behind where it needs to be

**The Ugly**:
- Corporate capture is real
- Many "safety" researchers are just doing capabilities with safety branding
- The community drama distracts from the work

## Who to Actually Learn From

1. **For Technical Depth**: Paul Christiano, John Wentworth
2. **For Practical ML Safety**: Victoria Krakovna, Evan Hubinger  
3. **For Interpretability**: Chris Olah, Neel Nanda
4. **For Big Picture Thinking**: Stuart Russell, Nick Bostrom
5. **For Keeping It Real**: Eliezer Yudkowsky, Connor Leahy

## Final Thoughts

The field needs more diverse voices - geographically, intellectually, and demographically. The Bay Area bubble is real and limiting. Some of the best safety work might come from outsiders who aren't captured by the existing paradigms.

Remember: Hero worship is counterproductive. These are smart people doing important work, but they're not infallible. Think for yourself.
