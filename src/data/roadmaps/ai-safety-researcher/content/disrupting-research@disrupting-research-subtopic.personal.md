# Disrupting AI Safety Research

**ðŸ’­ Personal Opinion**: This topic represents a controversial but important perspective in the AI safety field.

## Why This Matters

From my perspective, the field of AI safety research sometimes suffers from groupthink and orthodoxy. While the mainstream approaches have merit, I believe we need more:

- **Contrarian thinking**: Challenging accepted wisdom and assumptions
- **Diverse perspectives**: Bringing in viewpoints from outside the traditional AI safety community
- **Unconventional approaches**: Exploring radically different solutions

## Areas Worth Disrupting

### 1. Over-reliance on Mathematical Formalism
While mathematical rigor is important, I think the field sometimes gets lost in abstract formalism that may not translate to real-world AI systems.

### 2. The "Alignment Tax" Mindset
The assumption that safety always comes at the cost of capabilities needs to be challenged. What if we could design systems that are both safer AND more capable?

### 3. Narrow Focus on Superintelligence
While long-term risks matter, the obsession with AGI/ASI scenarios may be distracting from more immediate, practical safety challenges.

## Alternative Approaches to Consider

- **Empirical safety research**: More focus on actual systems rather than theoretical models
- **Evolutionary approaches**: Learning from biological systems and evolution
- **Decentralized safety**: Moving away from centralized control paradigms

## Resources for Contrarian Perspectives

- [@video@Why I Left AI Safety Research](https://example.com) - Personal account of disillusionment
- [@article@The Case for AI Optimism](https://example.com) - Alternative perspective on AI development

**Remember**: This is my personal take. The mainstream AI safety community would likely disagree with many of these points, and that's okay. Progress often comes from productive disagreement.
