# Disrupting AI Safety Research: How to Be a Productive Heretic

Let me tell you about the time I got laughed out of a conference room for suggesting that maybe, just maybe, we were thinking about AI alignment completely wrong. Six months later, half the room was working on variations of "my crazy idea." 

That's the thing about disruption in research - first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you're writing the textbook for next year's PhD students.

## My Journey from Good Soldier to Friendly Rebel

I started as a good little researcher, following the established paths, citing the right papers, using the accepted methods. I was productive! I was publishing! I was... bored out of my mind and increasingly convinced we were all polishing brass on the Titanic.

The moment everything changed was during a particularly mind-numbing discussion about reward function specification. Everyone was debating mathematical minutiae, and I just blurted out: "What if the whole frame of 'specifying rewards' is the problem? What if alignment isn't a specification problem but a negotiation process?"

Dead silence. Then someone said, "That's not how we do things."

And I thought: Maybe that's exactly the problem.

## The Heretic's Handbook

### Step 1: Question the Questions

Most AI safety research answers questions like:
- How do we specify the right objective function?
- How do we make AI systems robust?
- How do we interpret neural networks?

But what if these are the wrong questions? My favorite disruption technique is to ask:
- Why do we assume there IS a "right" objective function?
- What if robustness and capability are false dichotomies?
- Why do we assume human-understandable = safe?

The magic happens when you realize that every research question contains assumptions, and those assumptions might be completely wrong.

### Step 2: Find the Sacred Cows

Every field has ideas that "everyone knows" are true. In AI safety, some sacred cows I've spotted:

**"More interpretability is always better"**
Really? What if some forms of opacity are features, not bugs? What if trying to understand everything makes systems less safe?

**"We need to slow down AI development"**
But what if the current paradigm is fundamentally unsafe and slowing down just locks it in? What if we need to speed through this valley to reach safer peaks?

**"Human values should guide AI"**
Have you MET humans? Maybe AI should help us figure out better values, not just implement our current mess.

Sacred cow BBQ is my favorite research activity.

### Step 3: Cross-Pollinate Like Your Career Depends on It

My best disruptive ideas came from applying concepts from completely unrelated fields:

**From Ecology**: Treating AI safety like ecosystem management instead of machine control. Suddenly, concepts like "keystone species" and "trophic cascades" started making sense for AI systems.

**From Jazz**: What if AI alignment is like jazz improvisation - structured spontaneity with agreed-upon constraints rather than fixed scores?

**From Immunology**: Instead of trying to prevent all failures, what if we built AI systems with immune responses that could detect and respond to misalignment?

The trick is to dive DEEP into another field. Not just read the Wikipedia page, but really understand how experts in that field think.

## The Social Dynamics of Being a Heretic

### Building Your Rebel Alliance

You can't disrupt alone. Here's how I built my coalition of the willing:

1. **Find the Frustrated**: Look for researchers who sigh a lot in meetings. They're often thinking the same things but are too polite to say them.

2. **Start Small**: Begin with informal discussions. "Hey, crazy thought, but what if..." is less threatening than "YOUR ENTIRE RESEARCH AGENDA IS WRONG."

3. **Create Safe Spaces**: I started a reading group called "Dangerous Ideas in AI Safety." Rule #1: No idea too crazy. Rule #2: What's said in the group stays in the group.

4. **Document Everything**: When people say your ideas are crazy, you want receipts for when they later claim they thought of it first.

### Handling the Antibodies

Academic communities have immune systems, and they'll try to reject foreign ideas. Here's what I learned about dealing with resistance:

**The Dismissive Senior Researcher**: "That's not how we do things here."
- Response: "I know, that's why I'm suggesting it. How we do things isn't working."

**The Methodological Purist**: "Where's your mathematical formalism?"
- Response: "Coming. But first, let's check if the intuition is worth formalizing."

**The Funding Gatekeeper**: "This doesn't fit our research priorities."
- Response: "Your priorities were set when the field was different. Time for an update?"

**The Scared Graduate Student**: "Won't this hurt my career?"
- Response: "Following dying research directions will hurt it more."

## Practical Disruption Tactics

### The Trojan Horse Paper

Can't get your revolutionary idea published? Hide it inside a conventional paper. I once got a paradigm-shifting concept accepted by framing it as a "minor extension to existing work." By the time reviewers realized what it really was, it was already influencing thinking.

### The Workshop Coup

Organize a workshop at a major conference. Call it something innocuous like "Alternative Perspectives in AI Safety." Pack it with your fellow rebels. Use it to legitimize your disruptive ideas. Next year, there'll be three workshops on "your" topic.

### The Tool Trap

Build a tool that embodies your disruptive idea. People will use the tool because it's useful, and in doing so, they'll unconsciously adopt your paradigm. I've converted more researchers with GitHub repos than papers.

### The Blog Blitz

Academic publishing is slow. Blogs are fast. Write accessible posts about your ideas. If they resonate, you'll build an audience before the gatekeepers even notice. Some of my "rejected" papers became influential blog posts that shaped the field more than any journal article.

## When to Disrupt vs. When to Contribute

Not every contrarian thought is a disruption waiting to happen. Here's my filter:

**Disrupt when**:
- Current approaches have hit fundamental limits
- The questions being asked feel wrong
- Progress has stagnated despite effort
- You have a coherent alternative vision

**Don't disrupt when**:
- You just want attention
- You haven't deeply understood current approaches
- Your alternative is "let's just try random stuff"
- The current approach is actually working

## My Biggest Disruption Failures

**The Overly Ambitious Reframe**: I once tried to reframe ALL of AI safety as a special case of ecology. Too much, too fast. Lesson: Disrupt in digestible chunks.

**The Personal Attack Disguised as Disruption**: Early on, I conflated criticizing ideas with criticizing people. Made enemies instead of converts. Lesson: Attack ideas, embrace people.

**The Solution Without a Problem**: I developed an elaborate alternative framework for something that... wasn't actually broken. Lesson: Make sure there's a real need for disruption.

## The Emotional Rollercoaster

Being a disruptor is emotionally exhausting:
- **Months 1-6**: Excitement! You've seen something others haven't!
- **Months 6-12**: Frustration. Why doesn't anyone get it?
- **Months 12-18**: Doubt. Maybe I'm the one who's wrong?
- **Months 18-24**: Persistence. Some people are starting to listen.
- **Months 24+**: Vindication or pivot. Either way, you've learned.

The key is having a support network of fellow heretics who can remind you that all important ideas sounded crazy at first.

## Practical Advice for Aspiring Disruptors

1. **Read History**: Every established idea was once disruptive. Study how they won.

2. **Build Credibility First**: It's easier to disrupt from the inside. Earn your stripes, then rebel.

3. **Have a Day Job**: Disruption doesn't pay the bills initially. Keep doing "normal" research too.

4. **Document Your Journey**: When you succeed, people will want to know how. When you fail, you'll want to know why.

5. **Stay Humble**: You might be wrong. The establishment might be right. Keep testing.

6. **Play the Long Game**: Paradigm shifts take years, not months. Pace yourself.

## The Meta-Disruption

Here's my current heretical thought: What if the biggest disruption needed in AI safety is to stop thinking of it as a separate field? What if safety isn't something we add to AI but something that emerges from how we build AI communities, institutions, and practices?

But that's a disruption for another day...

## Your Turn

So what sacred cow are you ready to barbecue? What assumption is everyone making that might be completely wrong? What would AI safety look like if we started from entirely different premises?

The field needs heretics. It needs people willing to ask uncomfortable questions and pursue uncomfortable answers. It needs disruption.

Just remember: Being contrarian isn't the goal. Being right in a way that matters is the goal. Disruption is just the path when the established paths are leading nowhere.

Now go forth and productively rebel. The future of AI safety might depend on your "crazy" idea. ðŸš€
