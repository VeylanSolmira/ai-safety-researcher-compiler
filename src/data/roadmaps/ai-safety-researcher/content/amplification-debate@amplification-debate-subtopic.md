## Scalable Oversight Techniques

As AI systems become more capable, we need oversight methods that scale beyond human ability to directly evaluate outputs.

### Iterated Amplification (IDA)

-   **Core Idea:** Use AI assistance to amplify human oversight
-   **Process:** Human + AI system supervises training of new AI
-   **Iteration:** Each generation helps train the next
-   **Goal:** Maintain alignment while increasing capability

### AI Safety via Debate

-   **Adversarial Setup:** Two AIs debate, human judges
-   **Truth-Seeking:** Incentive to expose opponent's errors
-   **Scalability:** Humans can judge debates on complex topics
-   **Limitations:** Assumes truth has natural advantage

### Recursive Reward Modeling

-   Use AI to help evaluate AI behavior
-   Break complex tasks into simpler pieces
-   Maintain human oversight at each level
-   Scale to superhuman performance safely

### Challenges and Open Questions

-   Preserving alignment through amplification
-   Detecting manipulation in debates
-   Computational complexity
-   Philosophical questions about truth and judgment
